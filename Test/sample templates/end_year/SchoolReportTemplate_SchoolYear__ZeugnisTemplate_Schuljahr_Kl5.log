Sorry, but I'm not programmed to handle this case;

If you're in the wrong mode, you might be able to

Package fancyhdr Warning: \headheight is too small (90.0pt): 
(fancyhdr)                Make it at least 94.22237pt, for example:
(fancyhdr)                \setlength{\headheight}{94.22237pt}.
(fancyhdr)                You might also make \topmargin smaller to compensate:

(fancyhdr)                \addtolength{\topmargin}{-4.22237pt}.
